      "description": "In recent years, there has been a lot of buzz around microservices as the go-to architecture for developing modern applications. However, in this video, we explore the idea that you don't actually need microservices to build a successful application. \n\nWhile microservices can provide benefits such as scalability and flexibility, the truth is that they also come with their own set of challenges. Maintaining a microservices architecture can be complex, with multiple moving parts that require careful orchestration. Moreover, it may not always be necessary to break down your application into microservices as it can be overkill for smaller applications.\n\nIn fact, many successful applications have been built using a monolithic architecture. A well-designed monolith can still be scalable and modular, without the added complexity of microservices. \n\nThat being said, it's important to keep in mind that every application is different, and what works for one may not work for another. As you design your architecture, it's essential to consider the unique needs of your application and choose an approach that will work best for your specific requirements.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while microservices can be a great option for some applications, they are not always necessary. A monolithic architecture can still provide the modularity and scalability you need for a successful application. As you consider your options, make sure to carefully evaluate the pros and cons of each approach to determine what is best for your specific project.\n\n#microservices #systemdesign #softwarearchitecture \n\nDon't Forget to\n===========================================\n💯  Subscribe to Amigoscode -  http://bit.ly/2HpF5V8\n💯  Courses Available for free here - https://amigoscode.com/courses\n💯  Join Private Facebook Group and Discord - https://amigoscode.com/p/join-community\n\n🙊  Here are the goods for all my videos video 🙊 \n\n► Recommended Books\n===========================================\n- Clean Code - https://amzn.to/2UGDPlX\n- HTTP: The Definitive Guide  - https://amzn.to/2JDVi8s\n- Clean Architecture - https://amzn.to/2xOBNXW\n\n► Computer and Monitor\n===========================================\n- New Apple MacBook Pro - https://amzn.to/3464Mmn\n- Dell 27 INCH Ultrasharp U2719D Monitor - https://amzn.to/2xM3nW1\n- Double Arm Stand Desk Mount - https://amzn.to/3aYKKfs\n- USB C Hub Multiport Adapter - https://amzn.to/2Jz7NlL\n\n► Camera Gear\n=============================================\n- Sony ILCE7M3B Full Frame Mirrorless Camera - https://amzn.to/346QIJn\n- Sigma 16 mm F1.4 DC DN - https://amzn.to/2wbic3Q\n- Sigma 33B965 30 mm F1.4 DC DC - https://amzn.to/39G37Fd\n\n► IDE & Tools I use for coding 💻   🎒\n===========================================\n- ITerm\n- VsCode\n- GoLand\n- IntelliJ Ultimate\n- Sublime\n\nP.S\n ===========================================\n💯   Don't forget to subscribe | http://bit.ly/2HpF5V8\n💯  Join Private Facebook Group and Discord - https://amigoscode.com/p/join-community\n💯  Follow me on Instagram | http://bit.ly/2TSkA9w\n\n❤️  Thanks for watching",

      "description": "In this video, we'll explore n-tier architecture, a powerful software design pattern used to build scalable, modular, and maintainable applications.\n\nN-tier architecture divides an application into three logical layers: the presentation layer, the business layer, and the data layer.\n\nThe presentation layer handles the user interface and interactions, while the business layer implements the application's logic and processes, and the data layer stores and retrieves data. By separating these layers, we can create a flexible and modular system that's easier to develop, test, and maintain.\n\nIn this video, we'll cover:\n\n➡️ The benefits of n-tier architecture, including scalability, modularity, and maintainability\n\n➡️ The three layers of n-tier architecture, including their roles and responsibilities\n\n➡️  How n-tier architecture is used in real-world applications\nTips for designing and implementing n-tier architecture effectively\n\n➡️ How to test each layer\n\nWhether you're a software developer, architect, or just curious about how software works, this video will provide a clear and concise explanation of n-tier architecture and how it can help you build better software.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to our channel for more videos on software development, architecture, and best practices!\n\n🔥 Join the waiting list here: 🔗 https://waiting-list.amigoscode.com \n\nDon't Forget to\n===========================================\n💯  Subscribe to Amigoscode -  http://bit.ly/2HpF5V8\n💯  Courses Available for free here - https://amigoscode.com/courses\n💯  Join Private Facebook Group and Discord - https://amigoscode.com/p/join-community\n\n⭐  Table Of Contents ⭐\n===========================================\n00:00 - Intro\n01:12 - Full Stack Course\n02:31 - N Tier\n03:33 - Presentation Layer\n04:34 - Business Layer\n05:56 - Data Layer\n06:56; - The Benefits\n08:43 - Example\n19:28 - Outro\n\n🙊  Here are the goods for all my videos video 🙊 \n\n► Recommended Books\n===========================================\n- Clean Code - https://amzn.to/2UGDPlX\n- HTTP: The Definitive Guide  - https://amzn.to/2JDVi8s\n- Clean Architecture - https://amzn.to/2xOBNXW\n\n► Computer and Monitor\n===========================================\n- New Apple MacBook Pro - https://amzn.to/3464Mmn\n- Dell 27 INCH Ultrasharp U2719D Monitor - https://amzn.to/2xM3nW1\n- Double Arm Stand Desk Mount - https://amzn.to/3aYKKfs\n- USB C Hub Multiport Adapter - https://amzn.to/2Jz7NlL\n\n► Camera Gear\n=============================================\n- Sony ILCE7M3B Full Frame Mirrorless Camera - https://amzn.to/346QIJn\n- Sigma 16 mm F1.4 DC DN - https://amzn.to/2wbic3Q\n- Sigma 33B965 30 mm F1.4 DC DC - https://amzn.to/39G37Fd\n\n► IDE & Tools I use for coding 💻   🎒\n===========================================\n- ITerm\n- VsCode\n- GoLand\n- IntelliJ Ultimate\n- Sublime\n\nP.S\n ===========================================\n💯   Don't forget to subscribe | http://bit.ly/2HpF5V8\n💯  Join Private Facebook Group and Discord - https://amigoscode.com/p/join-community\n💯  Follow me on Instagram | http://bit.ly/2TSkA9w\n\n❤️  Thanks for watching",

Its a tool that must know.\n\nA container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.\n\nContainer images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images become containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.\n\nDocker containers that run on Docker Engine:\n\nStandard: Docker created the industry standard for containers, so they could be portable anywhere\nLightweight: Containers share the machine’s OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs\nSecure: Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry",

In the good old days we use to define every single step (code) what we wanted to accomplish, we used to write a lot of code for something very small (The Imperative approach).\n\nWhat Java Streams makes it easy to work with Collections and it gives you as a developer an API where you can ask what you want instead of defining the full implementation for the thing you want. (Declarative Programming)\n\nIf you not using Java Streams 😱 then you should take a moment and watch this video to learn more about it.\n\nHere are some resources\nCode: https://github.com/amigoscode/java-streams-youtube\nFree Course: https://bit.ly/2WxbPjI\n\nPS: \nSubscribe to my channel: https://youtube.com/amigoscode\nFollow on Instagram: https://instagram.com/amigoscode\n\nHappy coding 👊🏾",

All good software hows do it and its a best practice.\n\nIn this tutorial I teach how to use Mockito to mock objects, control their behaviours and how to verify that mocks where invoked with and without complex objects using Argument Captor.\n\nWhy use mocks ?\n\nUse mocks when you have testing the mocked class somewhere. Therefore no need to test it again in some other class.\n\nUse mocks when you depend on systems that may be unavailable to unit test and when its hard to test.\n\nEnjoy",

Bear in mind that only use this code as boiler plate or template as not every application will be the same, but the concepts of building it aren’t that much different.\n\nThis video tutorial also demonstrates the power of implementing to an interface and loose couple system.\n\nSo, this video is split in the following order\n\n1 – Overview\n2 – Spin up RDS (Amazon Relational Databases) instance.\n3 – Testing the connection using database client (SEQUEL PRO)\n3 – Download previous source code from git\n4 - Add and configure HikaryCP Datasource using property files\n5 –  Implement DAO interface, Learn SQL (CRUD) with JDBC Template\n6 – Test application using postman (Rest Client)\n7 – Spring profiles overview\n8 – Spin up second RDS (Amazon Relational Databases) instance to act as the production database\n9 – Configure Spring profiles and adding two run configurations\n10 – Test changes\n11 – Execute jar files with both profiles and see it in action\n12 – Shut down RDS instanaces to save our free 750 hours of usage.\n\nIMPORTANT READ THIS\n\nRemember that AWS (Amazon Web Services) only give you 750 hours for free. So, you are not using the instance or instances please go ahead and shutdown. If You go over 750 hours, then you will get charged. Nothing crazy but keep that in mind.\n\nIMPORTANT READ THIS\n\n\nPinned by Iam Djalas\nIam Djalas\n1 month ago (edited)\n2,301 subscribers\nAfter receiving lots of request to create a detailed course here we go everyone.  \nCourse Now Available here: https://www.udemy.com/spring-boot-for-software-engineers/\nMORE courses: https://amigoscode.teachable.com/\n\nSource code available at: https://github.com/djdjalas/SpringBootIn50/tree/springboot-db-intergration\n\nMake sure to change property files to point  to your own database.\n\nEnjoy and do not forget to SUBSCRIBE and let me know what you want to see next.\n\nThanks",

      "description": "\"FOR THOSE U HAVE NO IDEA ON WHAT DO FOR THE PRA CW\"\nFolks in this tutorial I teach how to add the jar file to the build path in order to have access to the weather forecast classes and its methods. Also I teach how to create a JFRAME with the getAcknowledgement method in a JLabel. I have made this tutorial for those who have no clue on what to do. This video won t help you to build the all app but helps you get started. Layouts there are many that u can use and use the one that you are most conf with.\n\n**Note that there are other ways to add the jar file to the build path**\n\nMake sure you structure you code in a efficient way and avoid code repetition. Good luck",
